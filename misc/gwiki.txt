This project provides an integration of R, which is a language for statistical computing and graphics, into Intellij IDEA. It aims to bring the best language for data mining and modeling in touch with the best IDE ever.

By implementing a parser for R, the plugin allows for syntax highlighting, intelligent code folding and completion, refactorings, and more.

=Installation=

  # Get Intellij IDEA, which is available as pro and and as free open-source community edition from [http://jetbrains.com JetBrains].
  # To install the plugin, just open the plugin manager in Intellij Idea, search for "R4Intellij" , and finally click install.

=Support=

Feel welcome to ask questions in the plugins [http://devnet.jetbrains.net/community/idea/plugins discussion forum] of Intellij. Don't forget to tag your posts with the tag r4intellij (otherwise we might not read it).

Before you asked questions, you should consider to read our [FAQ].

=Basic Usage=
Just drag an R-file into idea and start hacking. 

You can also create a new project (the type does not matter) and organize your work into modules with different content roots. Read the Intellij [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/webhelp/intellij-idea.html documentation] for more details about to do this.

==File extensions==
By default R4Intellij supports these file extensions:
.R
IntelliJ offers the possibility to link so far unknown file extensions to a plugin. Just choose R4Intellij to open files with this newly registered file extension as R files.

==Source code navigation==

The following features are supported
  * Go To --> Declaration (of symbols and locally defined functions)
  * View --> Quick Definition Lookup (of functions): This will show the signature and a short description

[http://dl.dropbox.com/u/422074/r4intellij/r_help_integration.png]

  * Search --> Highlight Usage: This will make Intellij to highlight all locations where a function or a symbol is being used
  * Brace matching: If you position the caret before or after a bracket then IntelliJ will highlight the other element of the pair of brackets.
  * File Structure View: In the structure view IntelliJ shows the functions and code sections of the R script.

Most of these functions use the default shortcuts of the Intellij platform. Custom shortcuts can be inferred from the menu entries.


=Code completion=
R4Intellij builds an index of your local R installation which allows for much better completion, local error highlighting, integrated documentation lookup and more.

To build the index of all packages installed in your R instance, R4Intellij needs . On most platforms it will guess it correctly, but you can adjust it if necessary in the preferences.

The following completion modes are available:
  * Basic word completion for variables and local functions
  * Coming soon: Package name completion in library statements
  * Coming soon: setwd() aware path completion
  * Coming soon: completion of package names in library statements
 
=Refactoring=
All refactorings can be accessed via the "Refactor" menu 
  * Renaming of symbols and functions

=Intentions=
Intentions are on-the-fly checks of your R scripts, that highlight problems and (optionally) suggest automatic quick fixes
  * Auto-import of packages given a function name

=Integration with R session=
  * Send selected code to R (which can be R, R64, or Terminal on MacOS and the RGui on windows)

=Planned & Coming soon=
  * Source code formatting
  * Code transformation fixes (like: Convert qplot to ggplot call)
  * More refactorings (Extract function; Extract variable)
  * More context-aware autocompletion for variables, functions and file paths
  * Inspections and quickfixes for common problems

=Platform features=

The main strength of our plugin is the underlying Intellij IDE. So if you have not worked with it before, read more about all its amazing [http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/index.html features]. It ships with everything from SCM integration (Git, Subversion, etc.), neat SQL integration, bash scripting support, and so many more interesting features. However, it's main "feature" is its usability. Give it a try!

=You're still not convinced? Try something else!=
