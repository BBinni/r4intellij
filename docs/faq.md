## I've installed a new package. How can I force the index to be rebuild?
The index will be updated when Intellij is restarted.

## R4Intellij fails to index package XY. What can I do?
Submit a ticket to our tracker. The indexing is known to fail occassionally, which is mainly because we have not yet discovered a fail-safe way to extract all package functions including their documentation.

## Why doesn't R4Intellij provide R-Session aware completion?
Because all it does is static code analysis. We don't plan any kind of R console for now. But feel welcome to join our project and get started with it.
